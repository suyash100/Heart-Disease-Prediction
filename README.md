# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this 21st century, people all over the globe are facing heart disease problems due to unhealthy living habits.
Most of the people don't have enough strong financial conditions to have expensive weekly check ups. 
So, to build a heart disease prediction model for the same, in this project we have compared efficiency of different machine learning algorithms to get to know the algorithm with maximum efficiency to get accurate results.
